# Yvensfobia's ICPC Team Reference Document

This repo hosts the [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) Team Reference Document (TRD) of the team *Yvensfobia: o medo de perder pro Yvens*.

This is a fork of [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl). For more information, please see its README.

Please note the PDF may contain more than 25 pages, the limit for TRDs in The ICPC World Finals and other contests (as of today, 2025-09-18). So, you may want to leave some contents out. Please see [here](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl?tab=readme-ov-file#customizing-kactl) how to do it.
